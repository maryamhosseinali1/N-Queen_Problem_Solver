This repository contains the implementation of the N-Queen Problem as part of a bio-computing project. The N-Queen problem is a classic computational challenge that involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal. This project explores the application of computational methods to solve this problem using efficient algorithms.

Features:
1) Backtracking Algorithm: The core approach used to find solutions for the N-Queen problem. This method ensures the placement of queens in a way that avoids conflicts, and it backtracks when necessary.
2) Customizable Board Size (N): The solution supports dynamic board sizes, allowing users to define any value of N.
